A Graphical User Interface(GUI) is the first thing your user sees and interacts with when he opens your application or website. Having a good GUI goes a long way in increasing your platform’s reputation and user count. A user interface usually includes a host of visual elements like icons, buttons, graphics, displayed text, and several other forms of input, like checkbox, text input boxes, and such.
It’s the combination of all these elements that makes up a vital part of your application or website’s user experience. Input to these visual elements can be from the usual mediums, such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens.
